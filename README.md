# video-subtitler
A tool for automatically captioning your .mp4 files, based on STT

## Design
The tool will feature a web page implementing a drag + drop menu for uploading an MP4 file.
Backend will use some library to process the video and add captions to it.
The webpage will return the video as a downloadable. Future versions might feature a "preview" page.
